<p>I am an experienced Information security architecture consultant based in Princeton, New Jersey. With over 30 years of professional experience, I have worked across various industries, including Finance, Government, Pharmaceutical, and Publishing. My expertise lies in Control Frameworks, Systems Engineering, and Security Architecture principles, which I have used to design, build, and manage the implementation of security controls for applications and computer systems. As an experienced professional in the field of cybersecurity, I possess a diverse set of technical skills and expertise in security frameworks that allow me to provide robust solutions to complex problems.</p>
<p>I develop and manage security frameworks, evaluate security products and services, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, manage security incidents, mentor and train junior staff, collaborate with other departments, develop and manage security budgets, and monitor emerging security threats.</p>
<p>I design and implement information security solutions, assess and manage security risks, provide technical expertise and guidance, develop and maintain security architecture, ensure compliance with security regulations, manage security incidents and breaches, and train and educate staff on security best practices and policies.</p>
<p>My technical expertise includes proficiency in various tools such as Nmap, MySQL, Wireshark, PHP, JavaScript, Perl, PostgreSQL, jQuery, SOAP, macOS, WordPress, CSS, Solaris, UNIX, awk, sed, grep, OpenSSL, Linux, Bash, SQL, Apache, and Nessus.</p>
<p>I deeply understand security frameworks such as <em>PCI DSS, CIS, NIST CSF, Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and OWASP</em>, enabling me to design and implement secure systems that meet compliance requirements.</p>
<p>I hold several certifications, including <em><a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/76f2a121-814e-4563-83cd-4c95d6588fb5">CISSP</a>, <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/5d6c6336-fc29-45f1-a26a-2f8614227691">CCSP</a>, and ITILv3 Foundation</em>. I have a <em>Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan</em>, a Bachelor of Arts from Drew University, and a Bachelor of Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>In my previous roles, I have worked as an information security architect with organisations such as Santander Holdings, CLS Group, the State of New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts, and as an information security specialist and information security analyst for Bristol Myers Squibb, Johnson and Johnson, Merrill Lynch, and Bloomberg LP. I have collaborated with enterprise architects, operational risk managers, business analysts, senior directors, and project managers. I have demonstrated strong leadership skills, including an objective and reality-focused view of systems, procedures, and organisational operations.</p>
<p>I am seeking opportunities in environments supporting remote-only work arrangements. I am also open to hybrid work arrangements within the following local area.</p>
